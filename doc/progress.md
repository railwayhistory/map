# Progress

The initial goal of the map is to provide an overview map of all of
Europe. This map provides an overview of the existing and past railway
network. It consists of the detail levels 0 to 2 and is rendered at a
scale of roughly 1:500,000 and smaller.

In parallel, the detailed map is being created. It consists of the detail
levels 3 to 5 and shows detailed information of a scaled down to roughly
1:20,000. As this is a lot more work, this map will progress a lot more
slowly.

The following shows the progress of the various countries and work regions
within countries for both the overview and detailed maps.

For countries not listed here, work has not started at all.


## BE: Belgium

The overview map currently only covers railway lines. Tram, metro, and
industrial lines are omitted.

| region         | overview  | detail      |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| entire country | complete¹ | not started |

¹ The overview map currently does not contain the light railways
  (buurtspoorwegen/chemins de fer d'intérêt local).


## CH: Switzerland

The overview map currently only covers railway lines and interurban tram
lines. City tram lines and industrial lines are omitted.

## DE: Germany

Germany has been split into regions roughly covering the last regional
divisions before privatization. These are identified by the letter used as
the first letter in the station codes. Region H has been further broken up
into G and H with G covering the part roughly west of the Weser river.
Regions E and K have been broken up into regions E, K, and P with P roughly
the former Wuppertal division and parts of region K east of the Rhine
river.

The overview map currently only covers current and former railway lines.
It omits metros, trams, and industrial lines except in cases where these
lines used to be former railway lines. Industrial railways that have been
given a VzG number are also included.

## FR: France

France has been split into regions roughly correlating with the first
digit of the line number of the RFN. 

| region             | overview     | detail      |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| 0 to 9             | RFN complete | not started |
| p (Paris)          | RFN complete | not started |


## GB: United Kingdom

The UK has been split into regions roughly based on British Rail’s original
regions with quite a few liberties taken to arrive at continuous areas.
Greater London has been given its own region with somewhat arbitrarily
chosen borders. A sketch of the borders of these regions is provided by
the file `research/gb/regions.osm` in this repository.

In addition, Northern Ireland forms its own region.

For Great Britain, the overview map currently aims to contain all lines that
have an Engineer’s Line Reference (ELR) as well as all London Underground
lines.

| region                          | overview    | detail      |

| M (London Midland Region)       | in progress | not started |
| N (North Eastern Region)        | in progress | not started |
| S (Southern Region)             | not started | not started |
| U (Northern Ireland – “Ulster”) | not started | not started |

missing, and gauge information is missing.
