# map
The map data for the railway history map.

## Progress

The initial goal of the map is to provide an overview map of all of
Europe. This map provides an overview of the existing and past railway
network. It consists of the detail levels 0 to 2 and is rendered at a
scale of roughly 1:500,000 and smaller.

In parallel, the detailed map is being created. It consists of the detail
levels 3 to 5 and shows detailed information of a scaled down to roughly
1:20,000. As this is a lot more work, this map will progress a lot more
slowly.

The following shows the progress of the various countries and work regions
within countries for both the overview and detailed maps.

For countries not listed here, work has not started at all.


### BE: Belgium

The overview map currently only covers railway lines. Tram, metro, and
industrial lines are omitted.

| region         | overview | detail      |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| entire country | complete | not started |


### DE: Germany

Germany has been split into regions roughly covering the last regional
divisions before privatization. These are identified by the letter used as
the first letter in the station codes. Region H has been further broken up
into G and H with G covering the part roughly west of the Weser river.
Regions E and K have been broken up into regions E, K, and P with P roughly
the former Wuppertal division and parts of region K east of the Rhine
river.

The overview map currently only covers current and former railway lines.
It omits metros, trams, and industrial lines except in cases where these
lines used to be former railway lines. Industrial railways that have been
given a VzG number are also included.

### FR: France

France has been split into regions roughly correlating with the first
digit of the line number of the RFN.

The overview map currently only covers current and previous lines of the RFN.

| region             | overview    | detail      |

### GB: United Kingdom

The UK has been split into regions based on Network Rail’s regions. These
have been numbered 0 to 9. Northern Ireland forms its own region labelled
NI. Note that these are solely used for map editing purposes and lines are
assigned to regions based on convenience rather than historical accuracy.

The overview map currently aims to contain all lines that have an
Engineer’s Line Reference (ELR).

| region                   | overview    | detail      |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
