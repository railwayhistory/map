# Regions are identified by a single letter based on the single letter
# abbreviation for the regional railway divusions as used as the first
# letter in the DS100 codes. Region H has been broken up into G and H with
# G covering the part roughly west of the river Weser. Regions E and K have
# been broken up into regions E, K, and P with P roughly the former Wuppertal
# division and parts of region K east of the Rhine.
